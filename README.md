# DailyCodingChalleges
My goal is to solve one programming challenge every week in 2020. I will be uploading my progress to GitHub on a weekly basis starting on 1/22/2020.

* Week 1 - Fibonacci Sequence.
* Week 2 - Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list can add up to k.
* Week 3 - Give the product of all numbers in an array except for the index one.
* Week 4 - Find the missing positive integer from an unsorted array.
