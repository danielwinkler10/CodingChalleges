# DailyCodingChalleges
My goal is to solve one programming challenge every day in 2020. I will be uploading my progress to GitHub on a daily basis starting on 1/22/2020.

* Day 1 - Fibonacci Sequence.
* Day 2 - Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list can add up to k.
